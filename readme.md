### Finally making a blog/portfolio I guess
Using [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
```Bash
yarn install
# Hot/Live Reloading
yarn dev 
# Production
yarn build
yarn start
```
Firefox is a bit buggy when it comes to the side menu.
I don't really know what i was thinking when i made that,
it's incredibly mobile unfriendly and a pain to work with
i'll replace it when i think of something nicer.
